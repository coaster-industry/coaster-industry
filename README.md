## Presentation
The initial purpose of the Coaster Indutry project is to provide a global map referencing the coaster industry. This will include :
* theme parks and amusement parks,
* roller coaster and attraction manufactors,
* suppliers,
* designing agencies,
* layout engineering offices,
* attraction assemblers,
* etc.

This interactive map will allow visitors to dig deep into the worldwide theme park industry. Links between all those companies involved will show its actual complexity. Also, it will help coaster enthusiasts to improve their knowledge, which is the reason to developp this application.


## Technical informations
The project is basically a website that will use the Mapbox library to create the map. The framework Flask (Python) is going to run the website.
